0.17.0 to 0.18.0:
  
  * ???
  

0.16.0 to 0.17.0:
  
  * Added Core.WumpusTypes to export opaque versions of
    datatypes from Core.PictureInternal. This should make
    the Haddock documentation more cohesive.
   
  * Moved the Core.PictureLanguage module into the Extra
    namespace (Extra.PictureLanguage). This module may change
    in detail, if not in spirit in the future as I'm not 
    very happy with it. Also this module is somewhat 
    \"higher-level\" than the modules in wumpus-core, so 
    a different home seems fitting. 
   
  * Removed CardinalPoint and boundaryPoint from BoundingBox.
  
  * Argument order of 'textlabel' and 'ztextlabel' changed so
    that Point2 is the last argument.
  
  * PathSegment constructor names changed - this is an internal
    change as the constructors are not exported.
  
  * Primitive type changed - moved Ellipse properties into 
    PrimEllipse type - internal change.
  
  * Removed dependency on \'old-time\'.


0.15.0 to 0.16.0:

  * Additions to Core.Geometry (direction, pvec, vangle, 
    circularModulo).

  * Fixed error with langle due to not accounting for circle 
    quadrants in Core.Geometry.

  * Point2 now derives Ord - so it can be used as a key for
    Data.Map.

  * Added escape-character handling to text output in PostScript.
    This was causing a nasty bug where a drawing would completely
    fail when special chars shown (GhostView gives little hint of 
    what is wrong when such errors are present).
 
  * Changed BoundingBox operation 'corners' to return a 4-tuple
    rather than a list.
  
  * Added centeredAt to PictureLanguage


0.14.0 to 0.15.0:

  * Added Named colours and "safe fonts" from wumpus-extra.
  
  * Added wumpus_core_version to track version number.

0.13.1 to 0.14.0:

  * Added draft user guide. 
  
  * Argument order changed for @ellipse@ and @zellispe@ in
    Wumpus.Core.Picture. 
  
  * Removed dependency on Data.Aviary.
  
  * Removed DList dependency.


0.13.0 to 0.13.1:

  * Wumpus.Core.SVG changed path_s to path_c - \'S\' was the 
    wrongSVG command to match PostScript\'s @curveto@.


0.12.0 to 0.13.0:

  * More Haddock documenting. 

  * @lowerLeftUpperRight@ removed from "Wumpus.Core.BoundingBox".

  * Added range checking and Ord obligation t to the @bbox@ 
    \'smart\' constructor.

  * Numeric instances for "Wumpus.Core.Colour" improved.

  * MatrixMult type class simplified

  * Dash Pattern made a list of on-off pairs rather than just a 
    list 

  * The modules - Wumpus.Core.PictureInternal, Wumpus.Core.PostScript,
    Wumpus.Core.SVG & Wumpus.Core.Utils - are no longer exposed.

  * Various operators in "Wumpus.Core.PictureLanguage" changed.

  * Wumpus.Core.TextEncoding split into an internal and a public 
    module (internal - Wumpus.Core.TextEncodingInternal, public - 
    Wumpus.Core.TextEncoder).
