version 0.6.0 (17 Jan 2010):
  * Revised the RenderingQuality module to use an opaque matrix
    type rather than a raw pointer. Acknowledgement - the code 
    and interface is derived from the Matrix class in HOpenGL.
  
  * Revised Image module - PixelData is now an opaque type rather
    than a raw pointer.

  * Work on Path module - pathBounds implemented. This module is
    entirely untested and may change again in the future.

version 0.5.0 (16 Jan 2010):
  * Split into 2 packages OpenVG (this package) and OpenVGRaw.

version 0.4.0 (13 Dec 2009):
  * LinearGradient type changed to be Vector4 VGfloat.
 
  * RadialGradient changed to (Vector4 VGfloat, VGfloat).

  * Removed Marshal and Unmarshal type classes, marshallBool and 
    unmarshalBool moved out of the BasicTypes module.

  * Type change for colorRampStops.

  * Name change - maxStops changed to maxColorRampStops.

  * PathType(..) changed to PathAbsRel(..).

  * Substantial changes to Haddock docs.

  * Error handling in VGU redone - the original code in 
    ErrorsInternal was taken wholesale from Sven Panne\'s 
    OpenGL binding to help me bootstrap OpenVG binding. 
    Regrettably I forgot to replace it or attribute it -
    I've now replaced it. Sincere apologies to Sven Panne.

version 0.3.0 (10 Dec 2009):
  * Changes to use the split OpenGL packages 

  * Added type coercions for the Size data type (these 
    might not be ideal).
