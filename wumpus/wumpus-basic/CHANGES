0.10.0 to 0.11.0:
 
  * Reworked arrowheads and connectors - connectors are now 
    configurable: there are functions to make connectors with 
    a left arrowhead, right arrowhead, none or both.  

  * Reworked shapes - internally shapes now create a @Path@ rather 
    than a @Graphic@ this means the path can be manipulated (e.g. 
    round cornered rectangles, diamonds... can be constructed).
    @Coordinate@ is no longer a @Shape@ - it is now similar object 
    but of a different type. Likewise, @FreeLabel@ has been 
    replaced by @Plaintext@ which is not a @Shape@, but has some 
    similar properties.

  * @Basic.Paths.Base@ - @Path@ type changed, @PathEmpty@ 
    constructor removed so empty paths cannot be created. This 
    allows a better API for taking points on a path. It also 
    means @Path@ is no longer an instance of Monoid. Type changes 
    to various functions (e.g. @tipR@, @tipL@) reflecting that as 
    paths cannot now be empty, functions on them can generally be 
    total. @toPrimPathU@ removed as converting to a PrimPath as 
    now always /safe/. @tracePoints@ renamed @traceLinePoints@, 
    @tracePointsCurve@ renamed @traceCurvePoints@, @midpoint@ 
    renamed @midway@.

  * @Basic.Graphic@ - the types @ConnDrawingR@, @ConnGraphic@ etc.
    have had their names expanded to @ConnectorDrawingR@, 
    @ConnectorGraphic@... 

  * @Basic.SafeFont@ - font names changed to use underscore 
    separators rather than camelCase. Wumpus generally uses 
    underscored names for /constants/.

  * Removed @conn@ from @Basic.Graphic.Drawing@. Connectors should 
    be used instead.

  * The class @DrawingCtxM@ now has @Applicative@ as a superclass. 

  * @lineSpacing@ renamed @baselineSpacing@.


0.9.0 to 0.10.0:

  * @Basic.Graphic.BaseClasses@ and @Basic.Graphic.BaseTypes@ 
    merged into same module so they can depend on each other 
    without orphans instances.

  * @DrawingF@ renamed to @DrawingR@, the related type synonyms
    have also been changed, e.g. @LocDrawingF@ is now 
    @LocDrawingR@.

  * Method names in the @DrawingCtxM@ class changed - @askCtx@ is
    now @askDC@, @localCtx@ is now @localize@. Removed the 
    functions @askDF@, @asksDF@, @pureDF@ that worked for 
    @DrawingF@ (now @DrawingR@), @DrawingR@ now uses the 
    Applicative\'s @pure@ and the @DrawingCtxM@ class for these 
    functionalities.

  * @Basic.Graphic.DrawingContext@ - renamed @primary_colour@ to
    @stroke_colour@ and @secondary_colour@ to @fill_colour@. The 
    setter functions has been similarly renamed.

  * Added the type synonym @DrawingContextF@ to 
    @Basic.Graphic.DrawingContext@. Changed relevant function
    signatures to use it.

  * Re-worked the Path modules - base types entirely different,
    connectors entirely different, monadic path construction 
    largely the same.

  * Initial work on round cornered paths.
 
  * Removed the type class @TextAnchor@ from @Basic.Anchors@. 
    This was a left-over from a previous implementation of 
    Shapes and is not relevant to the current implementation.
 
  * Added @DirectionContext@ to @Basic.Graphic@.

  * @localLG@ removed it can be acheived with composition -
    @localize upd . loc_graphic_function@. @lgappend@ is also 
    removed - it can be recreated applicatively.

0.8.0 to 0.9.0:

  * Re-worked @Basic.Text.LRSymbol@ changed the type name and the
    types of the run functions. Added more symbols and a new demo 
    @Symbols.hs@.

  * @ScalingContext@ added to @Basic.Graphic@. Changed 
    @monoTextWidth@ to take a character count, the old behaviour 
    is recreated by the new function @monoTextLength@. 

  * @Basic.Graphic.Chain@ removed. It is now superseded by
    @Basic.Chains@.

  * Added new property to @DrawingContext@ for line spacing 
    scaling factor, and added a new drawing primitive 
    @textlineMulti@ for multi-line, left justified labels.

  * Synthezied attribute /getters/ such as @textDimensions@ moved
    from @Basic.Graphic.DrawingContext@ to the new module
    @Basic.Graphic.Query@. The type of all the functions has 
    changed to DrawingF. @lowerxHeight@ is renamed 
    @monoLowerxHeight@ emphasizing that the metrics pertain to
    monospaced Courier font.

  * Added Shapes modules.
 
  * TurtleMonad module - the TurtleDrawing type and run functions
    have been removed and the internals have been reworked. 
    Turtle is now run solely as a /local effect/ within the 
    Drawing monad. 


0.7.0 to 0.8.0:

  * Re-introduced LRText and LRSymbol - they now work with 
    Wumpus-Core\'s kerning support.
 
  * Changes to @Graphic.Basic.BaseTypes@ - @DrawingObject@ 
    renamed to @DrawingF@. @HPrim@ wrapped as a newtype to 
    support a Monoid instance. Removed @appendGraphic@ and @gcat@ 
    as they can be achieved with @mappend@ and @mconcat@. 
    @appendAt@ renamed to @lgappend@. @PointT@ remaned to 
    @PointF@.

  * Changes to @Graphic.Basic.Drawing@ - @drawAt@, @drawAtImg@, 
    @drawConn@, @drawConnImg@ all removed. They are replaced 
    by @draw@ and @drawi@ together with then new @at@ and @conn@
    combinators.

  * Changes to @Basic.Graphic.PrimGraphic@ - @localDrawingContext@
    renamed to @localLG@ and moved to @Basic.Graphic.BaseTypes@.

  * Updates to @Basic.SafeFonts@ to work with changes to 
    @Wumpus.Core@.

0.6.0 to 0.7.0:

  * Major rework of Graphic types, the old types (AGraphic, 
    GraphicF etc.) and the old drawing monads have been removed. 
    The new types are based on the AGraphic and related types but 
    their implementation is different. The new types track the 
    /graphics state/ within the type (the DrawingContext) plus 
    how to draw themselves. For real drawings, graphics are 
    collected with a Writer-like monad the @Basic.Graphic.Drawing@ 
    monad which replaces the DrawingCtx and Trace monads. The 
    Turtle monad remains and has been updated to work with the new
    drawing monads.

  * LRText and LRSymbol modules temporarily removed as they 
    contradict the new, optimized kerning functionality in 
    @Wumpus.Core@.

0.5.0 to 0.6.0:

  * Updates to work with wumpus-core-0.30.0.

  * The code from @Basic.Graphic@ has been moved in to 
    @Basic.Graphic.Primitive@ - this module is due a major 
    overhaul. @Basic.Graphic@ is now an /import/ shim for
    @Basic.Graphic.Primitive@.

0.4.0 to 0.5.0:

  * Re-worked the PictureLanguage module.

  * SVGColours and X11Colours moved into @Wumpus.Basic.Colour@.
    Naming scheme for colours changed to use underscore between 
    words rather than camelCase.
 
  * Updates to work with wumpus-core-0.30.0.
 
0.3.0 to 0.4.0:

  * Reworked the monads. Monads.DrawingMonad replaces 
    Monads.Trace, Monads.DrawingCtx, Monads.ConsDrawing. The 
    SnocDrawing monads have been removed as they were a design
    mistake.

  * Removed MGraphicF type, added AGraphic.

  * Initial work on arrow drawing and extended text drawing.

0.2.0 to 0.3.0 :
 
  * Added the anchors, monads, drawingAttrs...

  * Added the module @PictureLanguage@ from Wumpus-Core.
    It is located with the path prefix @Wumpus.Deprecated@.
    At some point it will be replaced...

  * Basic.Graphic - rectangles and lines now take the supplied
    point to be the center rather than the bottom-left corner.
    Name changes - @circle@ changed to @disk@, @text@ changed to 
    @textline@.

0.1.1 to 0.2.0:

  * Added the module @Wumpus.Basic.Graphic@.

  * SafeFonts changed to be size neutral. PostScript\'s 
    @scalefont@ command (which wumpus-core uses in the generated
    output) should be able to scale to any integer size.

  * New demo @ColourCharts.hs@.

0.1.0 to 0.1.1:

  * Added missing LICENSE file to the Cabal file.

  * Added this CHANGES file.
