0.4.0 to 0.5.0
  
  * Re-implemented Text drawing. Some functionality moved to 
    Wumpus-Basic.
  
  * Re-implemented monadic Path Builder.
  
0.3.0 to 0.4.0:
  
  * Simplified Trapezium shape so it only produces isosceles
    Trapeziums.
  
  * Added Basis modules. These are \"mid-level\" modules similar 
    to ones in @Wumpus.Basic.Kernel.Objects@, however they are 
    considered less general so there are put here where they can 
    be imported individually (and so not pollute the namespace).
  
  * Removed the Turtle modules. The new @LocTrace@ and @RefTrace@ 
    modules supercede the Turtle modules.
  
0.2.0 to 0.3.0:

  * Moved Turtle and Grids into the @Wumpus.Drawing.Extras@
    name-space. Modules here are considered sketches.

  * Re-implemented arrowheads and connectors.

  * Re-implemented monadic path construction. This is now 
    essentially \"turtle drawing\" with a path trace.

  * Removed chains - a simplified implementation is now 
    provided by Wumpus-Basic.

  * Re-implemented and expanded Text.  

0.1.0 to 0.2.0:

  * Added new Shapes.

  * Move Geometry modules to Wumpus-Basic.

  * Re-implemented Chains.

  * Re-implemented LR-Text. Added CatText.

0.1.0:

  * Initial release - this is a split from @Wumpus-Basic@ making 
    the (very prototypical - read sub-alpha, unstable...) modules 
    in the @Drawing@ hierarchy a separate package.

  * Simplified Chains - chains are now regular lists (though often
    infinite). Drawings are made with chains using new zip-like
    functions.

  * Re-worked Shapes.

  * Re-worked Arrow and Arrow Tip types.

  * Re-worked ConnectorPaths.
