0.2.0 to 0.3.0:

  * Moved Turtle and Grids into the @Wumpus.Drawing.Extras@
    name-space. Modules here are considered sketches.

  * Re-implemented arrowheads and connectors.

  * Re-implemented monadic path construction. This is now 
    essentially \"turtle drawing\" with a path trace.

  * Removed chains - a simplified implementation is now 
    provided by Wumpus-Basic.

  * Re-implemented and expanded Text.  

0.1.0 to 0.2.0:

  * Added new Shapes.

  * Move Geometry modules to Wumpus-Basic.

  * Re-implemented Chains.

  * Re-implemented LR-Text. Added CatText.

0.1.0:

  * Initial release - this is a split from @Wumpus-Basic@ making 
    the (very prototypical - read sub-alpha, unstable...) modules 
    in the @Drawing@ hierarchy a separate package.

  * Simplified Chains - chains are now regular lists (though often
    infinite). Drawings are made with chains using new zip-like
    functions.

  * Re-worked Shapes.

  * Re-worked Arrow and Arrow Tip types.

  * Re-worked ConnectorPaths.
