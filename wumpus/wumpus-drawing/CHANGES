0.1.0:

  * Initial release - this is a split from @Wumpus-Basic@ making 
    the (very prototypical - read sub-alpha, unstable...) modules 
    in the @Drawing@ hierarchy a separate package.

  * Simplified Chains - chains are now regular lists (though often
    infinite). Drawings are made with chains using new zip-like
    functions.

  * Re-worked Shapes.

  * Re-worked Arrow and Arrow Tip types.

  * Re-worked ConnectorPaths.
