0.11.0 to 0.11.1:

  * Removed unused @InnerSpace@ constriant on functions in 
    @Wumpus.Tree.Draw@.

0.10.0 to 0.11.0:

  * Changed types of drawing functions so they can be run with 
    glyph metrics (read from file in the IO monad). 

  * Generalized the unit type of the /design/ functions to some 
    numeric @u@ rather than Double.

  * The demo has been duplicated - one version uses GhostScript 
    glyph metrics and the other Adobe glyph metrics, as the 
    metrics are in different formats and need different font 
    loaders from Wumpus-Basic.
  
0.9.0 to 0.10.0:

  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.

0.8.0 to 0.9.0:

  * Stopped re-exporting @DrawingContext@ from Wumpus-Basic in 
    the module Wumpus.Tree. Clients must now import 
    @Wumpus.Basic.Graphic@ to get the @DrawingContext@ type and 
    the constructor @StandardContext@.

  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.
 
0.7.0 to 0.8.0:

  * Changed drawTreePicture to use the @ScalingContext@ datatype
    from Wumpus.Basic. The type @ScaleFactors@ is now a type
    synonym for @SalingContext@ operation on all Doubles. 
 
  * Added an alternative drawing style /family tree/.
