0.14.0 to 0.15.0:

  * Updated to work with latest Wumpus libraries. 
    @ScalingContext@ has been temporarily added from Wumpus-Basic 
    (it was considered obsolete there). At some point the 
    functionality needs re-implementing so it can be removed from 
    Tree.
  
0.13.0 to 0.14.0:

  * Updated to work with latest Wumpus libraries. 

0.12.0 to 0.13.0:

  * Changed the specification of trees so that they are built in a
    monad. The bind operation of the monad allows /anchors/ to be 
    extracted from tree nodes so they can be annotated with 
    supplementary graphics. At the moment this is rather limited 
    as Wumpus-Basic and Wumpus-Drawing do not offer much support 
    for anchors other than the basic type classes.

  * Changed the type of the rendering functions so they produce a 
    TreeDrawing. This type is more suitable for building composite
    pictures than the previous type TreePicture. 

  * Also the rendering functions now take a start point for the 
    root node, again this should be more convenient for drawing 
    composite pictures - see the demo which now draws all the 
    example trees on one page.

  * Internally the tree design is now more flexible - trees can be 
    designed upwards or leftwards rightwards, rather than just 
    downwards; and edge drawing style is lifted out of the 
    rendering to use a supplied combinator. Currently these 
    features are not exposed by the API, the API needs more 
    thought (possibly warranting changes to Wumpus-Basic and 
    Wumpus-Drawing).


0.11.1 to 0.12.0:

  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.
 

0.11.0 to 0.11.1:

  * Removed unused @InnerSpace@ constriant on functions in 
    @Wumpus.Tree.Draw@.

0.10.0 to 0.11.0:

  * Changed types of drawing functions so they can be run with 
    glyph metrics (read from file in the IO monad). 

  * Generalized the unit type of the /design/ functions to some 
    numeric @u@ rather than Double.

  * The demo has been duplicated - one version uses GhostScript 
    glyph metrics and the other Adobe glyph metrics, as the 
    metrics are in different formats and need different font 
    loaders from Wumpus-Basic.
  
0.9.0 to 0.10.0:

  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.

0.8.0 to 0.9.0:

  * Stopped re-exporting @DrawingContext@ from Wumpus-Basic in 
    the module Wumpus.Tree. Clients must now import 
    @Wumpus.Basic.Graphic@ to get the @DrawingContext@ type and 
    the constructor @StandardContext@.

  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.
 
0.7.0 to 0.8.0:

  * Changed drawTreePicture to use the @ScalingContext@ datatype
    from Wumpus.Basic. The type @ScaleFactors@ is now a type
    synonym for @SalingContext@ operation on all Doubles. 
 
  * Added an alternative drawing style /family tree/.
 
0.6.0 to 0.7.0:
 
  * More example trees in Demo01.hs.

  * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic.

0.5.0 to 0.6.0:
 
  * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic.

0.4.0 to 0.5.0:

  * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic. Nothing new.

0.3.0 to 0.4.0:

  * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic. Nothing new.


0.2.0 to 0.3.0

  * Updated to track changes in Wumpus-Basic. No new 
    functionality.

0.1.0 to 0.2.0:

  * Changed internals to use ConsDrawing monad as Wumpus-Basic
    has changed.

  * Internal change to use AGraphic rather than MGraphicF 

0.1.0:

  * First release.
