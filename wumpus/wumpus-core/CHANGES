0.36.0 to 0.37.0:

  * The bounding box constructors have been renamed - @bbox@ is 
    now @boundingBox@ and @obbox@ becomes @oboundingBox@. The 
    rationale for this change is that the names very cryptic in 
    the first place and the constructors are used infrequently 
    when @bbox@ in particular makes a descriptive variable name.

  * Changes to the Picture and Primitive types to enable better
    concatenation which is used heavily by Wumpus-Basic. The 
    Picture API exposes a new function @primCat@.

  * SVG /font delta context/ change - font deltas are now 
    annotated on Primitives not Pictures. The type of the 
    function @fontDeltaContext@ in @Core.Picture@ has changed 
    accordingly.

  * SVG hyperlink change - hyperlinks no longer group primitives
    (although a group of primitives can be hyperlinked). The 
    function @xlinkGroup@ has been removed from @Core.Picture@, 
    it is replaced by @xlink@.

  * @Core.Picture@ - the argument order for the function 
    @rtextlabel@ has been changed, the positions of the angle and 
    bottom-left corner have been swapped.

0.35.0 to 0.36.0:

  * API / behaviour change - rotation on primitives changed. New 
    functions have been added to create rotated text labels and 
    ellipses (@rtextlabel@, @rstrokeEllipse@, etc.), and 
    Primitives have been made instances of the Affine classes
    except for the general matrix Transform class. The old
    functions for transforming Primitives (@rotatePrim@, 
    @scalePrim@, etc.) have been removed. The demos (Rotated.hs,
    Scaled.hs, Translated.hs) have been removed as they pertain 
    to the old behaviour, there are new demos highlighting the
    new behaviour (TransformEllipse.hs, etc.).

  * Major change - removed the PrimElement type. The (opaque) 
    Primitive type has been changed to incorporate a grouping 
    constructor equivalent to PrimElement\'s @XLinkGroup@ 
    contructor. The change has made the implementation of SVG 
    hyperlinks more efficient, but has forced various type 
    signatures to change in @Core.Picture@. Client code will 
    also have to change type signatures - @PrimElement@ becomes
    @Primitive@.

  * @Core.PtSize@ - the class @FromPtSize@ has been given a @Num@
    superclass constraint. This can shorten type signatures of 
    functions that use @fromPtSize@.

  * Corrected a bug where textlabels would generate an invalid
    bounding box and cause a runtime error when supplied with an
    empty string. Now there is no runtime error - and /no-ops/ 
    are generated in the output.

  * Internal changes - moved @PrimCTM@ from @Core.PictureInternal@
    into separate module. Moved /utility/ modules into their own 
    directory @Utils@. Move /text/ modules into their own 
    directory @Text@. 

  * Removed dependency on @algebra@ for @Semigroup@. The 
    equivalent @append@ operation on @BoundingBox@ is 
    @boundaryUnion@.

  * Renamed the @Core.GraphicsState@ to @Core.GraphicProps@. 
    Moved the property datatypes from @Core.PictureInternal@ into 
    @Core.GraphicProps@ (StrokeProps, LabelProps, etc.).

  * Moved @wumpus_default_font@ from @Core.Picture@ into 
    @Core.Graphic.Props@.

  * Haddock docs improved.

0.34.0 to 0.35.0:

  * Bug fix - PostScript output - when more than one stroke 
    property changed the changes were concatenated without 
    a separator. This generated invalid PostScript. Now fixed.

  * Documentation updates to the guide and the Haddock docs.

0.33.0 to 0.34.0:

  * Clipping paths fixed. Previously they did not work for SVG or
    PostScript.

  * @picOver@ fixed. Drawing order was changed in version 0.33.0, 
    but @picOver@ was not updated accordingly (so it actually 
    started drawing pictures /under/). It now works correctly.

  * The lexer for escape characters embedded in label strings has 
    been rewritten. It now supports octal and hexadecimal codes.
  

0.32.0 to 0.33.0:

  * Major change - reworked support for text encoding. Encoding 
    maps are now linked with fonts - it was spotted that the 
    Symbol font does not use the Latin1 names. The @TextEncoder@ 
    data type has been changed and there is a new @FontEncoder@ 
    data type. There are also new modules for the Symbol Font 
    encoder table and for the /Default Encoder/ which 
    accommodates both Latin1 and the Symbol font. This has also 
    mandated changes to the @FontFace@ data type.
 
  * Major change - the printing order has been changed. The first 
    element in a @frame@ of Prims is draw first. This means it 
    appears first in the output file (this makes sense) - it also 
    means it is at the back in the Z-Order. This latter point 
    might not be so intuitive, but changing the printing order at 
    least makes Wumpus-Core match SVG and PostScript.

  * Changed the visiblity of the new colours (yellow, cyan, 
    magenta) to be hidden at the top level. They can be exposed
    by importing @Wumpus.Core.Colour@. 

  * @Wumpus.Core.FontSize@ - added @spacerWidth@ function.

0.31.0 to 0.32.0:

  * Major API changes to @Core.Picture@ for XML hyperlinks.
    Hyperlinks now group one-or-more Primitives (path or label), 
    instead of being attached to a single Primitive. This better
    corresponds with XML but it has made the Picture type more 
    complicated, and has mandated significant changes to the 
    Picture API. All the hyperlink variants of the Primitive 
    constructors have been removed (xcstroke, xfill, xtextlabel, 
    ...), and hyperlinks are now created with @xlinkGroup@. 

  * The type signatures for the /primitive/ constructors (fill, 
    cstroke, textlabel, ...) in the Picture API have changed and 
    are now more complicated as there is an extra layer of 
    indirection in the type hierarchy.

  * The primitive constructors for filled and stroked paths and 
    ellipses have been renamed: @bordered@ is now @fillStroke@,
    @borderedEllipse@ is now @fillStrokeEllipse@.

  * @Core.FontSize@ - the arguments to the function @textBounds@
    have been changed to take the String in question, rather than 
    its precomputed length. The size of the string is then 
    calculated with the new function @charCount@ which takes into 
    account escaped characters.

  * Added @yellow@, @cyan@ and @magenta@ to the predefined 
    colours in @Core.Colour@.

0.30.0 to 0.31.0:

  * Extended the label type to optionally handle horizontal
    or vertical \"kerning\". This can be efficiently implemented 
    in SVG.

  * Major API change - the Primitive constructors defined in 
    @Core.PictureLanguage@ are no longer overloaded (@cstroke@, 
    @ostroke@, @fill@, @textlabel@, @ellipse@). The respective 
    classes (@Stroke@, @TextLabel@, @Ellipse@) have been removed
    and the constructors now have monomorphic types. This is 
    because Wumpus-Core now only has one colour type and stroke
    attributes are now a single type, so polymorphism became
    less useful (and the simplicity of monomorphic types became
    more favourable). @ellipse@ is no longer a constructor 
    instead there variants @fillEllipse@ and @strokeEllipse@.

  * Added support for /bordered/ closed paths - i.e. paths that
    are both stroked and filled. These can be efficiently drawn 
    in SVG with a single @path@ element.

  * Changed StrokeAttr representation to be a regular data type
    rather than a list of /deltas/ - i.e. differences to the 
    graphics state.

  * Added SVG font attribute /delta optimizations/ to help reduce 
    SVG code size - via the @fontDeltaContext@ function in 
    @Core.Picture@. This functionality was partially inplemented 
    in the last release using the @GSUpdate@ datatype - this 
    datatype it is now called @FontCtx@.

  * Some internal work documenting text encoding.

0.23.0 to 0.30.0:

  * Substantial changes - the output machinery has been heavily 
    modified, the intention was to reduce the use of matrix 
    transformations in SVG output. Though this goal has not been 
    achieved, some code-size improvements in the SVG output have 
    been made. 

  * The code generation monads have been changed - Wumpus no 
    longer uses a writer monad for code generation, but it will
    keep the Wumpus name.

  * Added support for hyperlinks in the SVG output.

  * Improved internal pretty printing and added the function 
    @printPicture@ for debugging.

  * The @Core.Colour@ module has been simplified to support just 
    one (new) type - RGBi, and the conversion type class 
    @PSColour@ has been eliminated.

  * @Core.Picture@ - the type of the @frame@ function has been 
    changed to take a list of Primitives rather than a single 
    Primitive. The function @frameMulti@ which previously 
    provided this functionality has been removed. SVG hyperlinks
    are now supported for Primitives. 
 
  * The default font size has been changed to 14 pt. 

  * The Path datatype has been renamed PrimPath, likewise Ellipse 
    is now PrimEllispe and Label becomes PrimLabel.

  * @Core.Geometry@ now longer defines an affine frame datatype.

  * @Core.BoundingBox@ module changed significantly. The corner 
    functions (@boundaryBottomLeft@, etc.) have been removed, 
    along with the plane functions (@leftPlane@, etc.). Some 
    functions have been given more verbose names - @corners@ is 
    now @boundaryCorners@, @within@ is now @withinBoundary@ and 
    @union@ is now @boundaryUnion@. 

0.22.0 TO 0.23.0:
 
  * @Basic.GraphicsState@ - extracted the font face fields from 
    @FontAttr@ datatype into a separate datatype @FontFace@.
 
  * Added @PtSize@ a numeric type wrapping Double. This is 
    specifically for text size calculations, vis the 
    @Core.FontSize@ module.

  * Changed all functions in @Core.FontSize@ to return @PtSize@
    instead of a polymorphic type @u@ (where @u@ is an instance 
    of Fractional). To get to another unit type rather than 
    FontSize use an explicit conversion that scales the value 
    accordingly.

  * Added FromPtSize class constraints to various functions in
    @Core.Picture@.

  * Added @charWidth@ to @Core.FontSize@.

  * Added @vlength@ to @Core.Geometry@

0.21.0 to 0.22.0:

  * Moved the deprecated module @Wumpus.Extra.PictureLanguage@
    into the package Wumpus-Basic along with the example 
    @Picture.hs@.

  * Added vec as a synonym for the constructor V2.

  * Changed some of the Core.FontSize to use better terminology. 
    Thus some of the constants have changed. Added a new example
    @FontMetrics.hs@ to illustrate how FontSize works. 
    Particularly, the function @capHeight@ has been replaced with
    the function @numeralHeight@ which has better semantics.

  * The CTM data type and ToCTM class are now hidden in the
    top-level import module @Wumpus.Core@. They can be accessed
    by importing @Wumpus.Core.GraphicsState@ directly.

  * Exposed the PSUnit type class. 

0.20.0 to 0.21.0:

  * Removed the Primitive instances of the Affine transformation 
    classes. They have been replaced with special transformation 
    functions: @rotatePrimitive@, @scalePrimitive@, 
    @translatePrimitive@. As Primitives are not in an affine 
    frame until they are lifted to Pictures the affine instances 
    had ill-conceived semantics.

  * Due to changes to accommodate the new non-affine  
    transformations, many of the class obligations have changed 
    on the @unit@ of Pictures, Primitives, Bounding Boxes etc. 
    Generally many class contexts that previously required 
    Fractional and Ord on the unit have changed to Real and 
    Floating.

  * Removed demo/AffineTest04.hs - there is no longer a 
    @rotateAbout@ operation on Primitives as they do not exist 
    in an affine frame until they they are lifted to Pictures.
    Added - Scaled.hs, Rotated.hs, Translated,hs.
 
  * Removed the UndecidableInstances pragma from 
    Core.PictureInternal. It looks like Core.Geometry will always 
    needs UndecidableInstances though.

  * Removed the Ord superclass constriant from the @Stroke@ and
    @Fill@ classes and derived operations (e.g. @zostroke@).

0.19.0 to 0.20.0:
  
  * Removed the modules:
    (1) Wumpus.Extra.SafeFonts
    (2) Wumpus.Extra.SVGColours@
    (3) Wumpus.Extra.X11Colours 
    - they are now in the package @wumpus-basic@.
  
  * Removed the example FontPic.hs to @wumpus-basic@.
  
  * Renamed some functions in Core.BoundingBox: 
    (1) @trace@ changed to @traceBoundary@, (2) @retrace@ 
    changed to @retraceBoundary@.
   
  * Fixed bug with @picOver@, previously the zorder was wrong 
    and the function was actually working as /picUnder/. 
  
  * Added @capHeight@ to FontSize - get the size of an upper 
    case letter without ascenders of descenders.
  
  * Guide updated regarding the new package @wumpus-basic@.
  
0.18.0 to 0.19.0:
  
  * Added @Transform@ type class to apply a matrix transformation
    directly.
  
  * Changed the ordering of picture drawing in PostScript and SVG
    output so the list gets drawn from tail to head with right 
    folds. This makes the list order of pictures match their 
    zorder.
  
  * Renamed the function @withinBB@ (Core.BoundingBox) to 
    @within@.
  
  * On many type signatures with e.g. Points, I\'ve changed the 
    parameter name on the type constructor from @a@ to @u@.
    This is to indicate that @u@ is some unit - almost always a
    Double. e.g @Point2 a@ becomes @Point2 u@ and all the class
    obligations change lexically as well @Floating a =>@ to 
    @Floating u =>@. Superficially this means a lot of type 
    signatures have diffs but haven\'t really changed. 
  
  * Added function @bezierCircle@ to generate the Bezier curve 
    points for arcs describing a circle.
  
  * Added new demo - MultiPic. The PostScript it generates
    is efficient - no extraneous use of @concat@. 
  
  * Added wumpus_default_font constant.


0.17.0 to 0.18.0:
  
  * Added instances of the affine operation classes (Scale, 
    Rotate ...) for Primitives (path, text label, ellipse).

  * Added some picture composition functions to Core.Picture.
    These are useful for testing where the type class 
    complications of Extra.PictureLanguage are an overhead.  

  * Added iRGB to Core.Colour - create RGB colours with 
    integer components [0..255] - and iHSB, iGrey.

  * Added some test modules for the affine transformations.
    These illustrate a quirk in Wumpus where, under affine 
    transformation, Pictures may generate a larger bounding box 
    than composite primitives.

  * Minor change - ztextlabal changed to use 24pt type rather 
    than 12pt. 

  * Corrected the cabal file to include the correct files for 
    the manual. The Haskell source file @WorldFrame.hs@ was 
    missing with the generated file @WorldFrame.eps@ incorrectly 
    included instead.

0.16.0 to 0.17.0:
  
  * Added Core.WumpusTypes to export opaque versions of
    datatypes from Core.PictureInternal. This should make
    the Haddock documentation more cohesive.
   
  * Moved the Core.PictureLanguage module into the Extra
    namespace (Extra.PictureLanguage). This module may change
    in detail, if not in spirit in the future as I'm not 
    very happy with it. Also this module is somewhat 
    \"higher-level\" than the modules in wumpus-core, so 
    a different home seems fitting. 
   
  * Removed CardinalPoint and boundaryPoint from BoundingBox.
  
  * Argument order of 'textlabel' and 'ztextlabel' changed so
    that Point2 is the last argument.
  
  * PathSegment constructor names changed - this is an internal
    change as the constructors are not exported.
  
  * Primitive type changed - moved Ellipse properties into 
    PrimEllipse type - internal change.
  
  * Removed dependency on \'old-time\'.

0.15.0 to 0.16.0:

  * Additions to Core.Geometry (direction, pvec, vangle, 
    circularModulo).

  * Fixed error with langle due to not accounting for circle 
    quadrants in Core.Geometry.

  * Point2 now derives Ord - so it can be used as a key for
    Data.Map.

  * Added escape-character handling to text output in PostScript.
    This was causing a nasty bug where a drawing would completely
    fail when special chars shown (GhostView gives little hint of 
    what is wrong when such errors are present).
 
  * Changed BoundingBox operation 'corners' to return a 4-tuple
    rather than a list.
  
  * Added centeredAt to PictureLanguage


0.14.0 to 0.15.0:

  * Added Named colours and "safe fonts" from wumpus-extra.
  
  * Added wumpus_core_version to track version number.

0.13.1 to 0.14.0:

  * Added draft user guide. 
  
  * Argument order changed for @ellipse@ and @zellispe@ in
    Wumpus.Core.Picture. 
  
  * Removed dependency on Data.Aviary.
  
  * Removed DList dependency.

0.13.0 to 0.13.1:

  * Wumpus.Core.SVG changed path_s to path_c - \'S\' was the 
    wrongSVG command to match PostScript\'s @curveto@.

0.12.0 to 0.13.0:

  * More Haddock documenting. 

  * @lowerLeftUpperRight@ removed from "Wumpus.Core.BoundingBox".

  * Added range checking and Ord obligation t to the @bbox@ 
    \'smart\' constructor.

  * Numeric instances for "Wumpus.Core.Colour" improved.

  * MatrixMult type class simplified

  * Dash Pattern made a list of on-off pairs rather than just a 
    list 

  * The modules - Wumpus.Core.PictureInternal, Wumpus.Core.PostScript,
    Wumpus.Core.SVG & Wumpus.Core.Utils - are no longer exposed.

  * Various operators in "Wumpus.Core.PictureLanguage" changed.

  * Wumpus.Core.TextEncoding split into an internal and a public 
    module (internal - Wumpus.Core.TextEncodingInternal, public - 
    Wumpus.Core.TextEncoder).
