Test drivers

Demo parses a post-processed C file and pretty prints it
> ghc --make -i./Language/C/AG Demo.hs

CCWrapper.hs is the original test driver from C2HS
> ghc --make CCWrapper.hs

To regenerate Demo needs Frown & UUAG, CCWrapper needs Frown.
At the moment there is no top level makefile or cabal file to regenerate, cd to 
Language/C/Frown and type make. For Demo you must also remake the pretty 
printer, cd to Language/C/AG and type make.
