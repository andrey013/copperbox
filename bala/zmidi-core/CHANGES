0.2.0 to 0.3.0:

  * Revised naming of the MIDI data types. All data types now have 
  the prefix Midi (previously only MidiFile followed this scheme).
  The rationale for this is client software, that might want a 
  higher-level representation, is then free to use the more 
  generic names Track, Message, etc.

  * Moved internal dataypes (SplitByte, Varlen) into a private 
  module.

0.1.0 to 0.2.0:

  * Added a top-level /shim/ module to import all the exposed
    modules. Added a version number module

0.1.0:

  * Initial release.
